BUNDY provides an authoritative DNS server (with in-memory and SQLite3
backends), DNSSEC support, dynamic DNS, zone transfers.  Supplementary
components are included for statistics collection and reporting and
remote configuration and control are included, as is an experimental
recursive nameserver with support for forwarding. It is the
continuation of the BIND 10 project from the ISC hosted at
http://bind10.isc.org/.

Since the June 2013 1.1.0 BIND 10 release, the new DNS highlights
include incoming zone transfer statistics, support for CAA and TLSA
resource records, and the zone loader now supports the zone file
$GENERATE directive.  Note that the bundy-xfrin "use_ixfr"
configuration item is deprecated and a new configuration
"zones/request_ixfr" may be used to replace it.  Also use
"database_file" under the "data_sources" module for bundy-xfrin
inbound transfers and use bundy-loadzone -e option to create an empty
zone prior to the first transfer.

The suite also provides DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers, a dynamic DNS
component, a DHCP performance testing program, and a C++ library
for DHCP.  ISC is continuing with the development of these components
in a new project, Kea.

For information about the Kea project, please visit http://kea.isc.org/.
If you have any questions or comments about working with the DHCP
code, you may post them to the Kea DHCP Mailing List
https://lists.isc.org/mailman/listinfo/kea-users.

For the full commit history, please see the ChangeLog and the git
Log.

Installation details are documented in the Guide
(http://bundy-dns.de/documentation.html).

The ./configure options --disable-dns and --disable-dhcp
may be used to provide an optional DHCP- or DNS-only build and
installation.
