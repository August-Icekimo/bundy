class SegmentInfo:
    """A base class to maintain information about memory segments.

    An instance of this class corresponds to the memory segment used
    for in-memory cache of a specific single data source.  It manages
    information to set/reset the latest effective segment (such as
    path to a memory mapped file) and sets of other modules using the
    segment.

    Since there can be several different types of memory segments,
    the top level class provides abstract interfaces independent from
    segment-type specific details.  Such details are expected to be
    delegated to subclasses corresponding to specific types of segments.

    A segment always begins with the 'INIT' stage, and completes validating
    segments for readers and the writer.  This phase is intended to be used
    to perform some initial validation on the segments before actually
    using them (e.g., some segment implementation may check data integrity),
    but details are up to the specific segment implementation and can even be
    no-op.  This phase is also intended to be used to be synchronized
    with existing readers that may be using segments in case memmgr has
    restarted.  At the completion of the V_SYNCHRONIZING state, the memmgr
    can be sure that no reader is using the writer version of the segment.
    On the completion of W_VALIDATING, the segment is in use, and will
    run normal cylce of updating.
